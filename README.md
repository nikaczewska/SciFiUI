# Description of the assignment

This assignment is an implementation of a SciFi User Interface.
For my assignment I decided to implement my own version of the interface used in a TV Series called "Shadowhunters"
This series is based off a series of books called "The Mortal Instruments" by Cassandra Clare.
This UI is initially supposed to provide the user with information. You will be able to find different individuals 
as well as demons on a map. As well as that, there will be a section which will provide a picture and description of
the runes used by Shadowhunters on a daily basis.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
